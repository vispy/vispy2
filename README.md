VisPy is a **high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization library**.
VisPy leverages the computational power of modern **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** library to display very large datasets.

Applications of VisPy include:

-  High-quality interactive scientific plots with millions of points.
-  Direct visualization of real-time data.
-  Fast interactive visualization of 3D models (meshes, volume rendering).
-  OpenGL visualization demos.
-  Scientific GUIs with fast, scalable visualization widgets.

## Current Status

VisPy 2 is a new project and does not follow the VisPy 0.x codebase. VisPy 2 is based on the graphics server protocol (GSP), matplotlib, and Datoviz. It is still experimental.

The [v0.x codebase](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) is available here.

## Code of Conduct

The VisPy community requires its members to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
In this CoC you will find the expectations of members, the penalties for violating these expectations, and how violations can be reported to the members of the community in charge of enforcing this Code of Conduct.

## Governance

The VisPy project maintainers make decisions about the project based on a simple consensus model. This is described in more detail on the [governance page](https://vispy.org/governance/GOVERNANCE.html) of the vispy website as well as the [list of maintainers](https://vispy.org/governance/MAINTAINERS.html).

In addition to decisions about the VisPy project, there is also a steering committee for the overall VisPy organization. More information about this committee can also be found on the [steering committee page](https://vispy.org/org/STEERING-COMMITTEE.html) of the vispy website, along with the organization's [charter](https://vispy.org/org/CHARTER.html) other related documents (linked in the charter).

## Genesis

VisPy began when four developers with their own visualization libraries decided to team up:

* [Luke Campagnola](http://luke.campagnola.me/) with [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
* [Almar Klein](http://www.almarklein.org/) with [Visvis](https://github.com/almarklein/visvis)
* [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net) with [Galry](https://github.com/rossant/galry)
* [Nicolas Rougier](http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/index.html) with [Glumpy](https://github.com/rougier/Glumpy)

Now VisPy looks to build on the expertise of these developers and the broader open-source community to build a high-performance GPU library.
